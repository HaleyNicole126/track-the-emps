  ## Description
  Track the Emps is a command-line application that helps users view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company. This project utilizes Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to create a content management system to manage a company's employee database.

  ## Installation
  Run `npm i` from the root directory to install the necessary dependencies. Then, you should be ready to run the application from your command line.

  ## Usage
  To invoke the application, run `npm start` or `node server.js` from the terminal in your root directory. You will then see a menu where you can use the arrow keys to select an option and then hit enter. Options to view all departments, view all roles, and view all employees will present a formatted table showing information about the departments, roles, and employees in the database. Options to add a department, add a role, and add and employee will prompt for more information about the department, role, or employee and then add that information to the database. There are also options to update employees and delete departments, roles, and employees.
